**ZeldaSource** is a freelance-created website by [Gabe Fletcher](https://bit.ly/gabefletch), powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com), themed with [Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/tree/core), and deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

ZeldaSource's goal is to provide a simple way to get access to every release of every Zelda title across every region. 
You can view ZeldaSource's rom list at the [``romlist``](https://github.com/ZeldaSource/romlist#romlist) repository.

Created with tools by [@shuding](https://github.com/shuding) and [@pacocoursey](https://github.com/pacocoursey) at [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Released under the MIT license.

***The ZeldaSource site is still under heavy construction.***
